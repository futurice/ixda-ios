I got my BFA at Savannah College of Art and Design, where I studied Industrial Design with a focus on Interaction Design. My first UX job was at EffectiveUI after networking on IXDA 2011. I was a UX Designer, wrote a few blog posts for the company, and helped with employment satisfaction. I worked at EffectiveUI for 3 1\/2 years. It was a great learning experience for me. I was able to collaborate with many talented people and in great projects. After gathering all this knowledge, I decided to move back to Mexico and apply the skills I have learned. I started working with Multiplica. Now I work as a freelancer, helping from time to time Multiplica and Comercio Digital. One of my first projects, coming back to M&eacute;xico, was the private area of a financial service.

  "about":"As a Senior Interaction Designer, I help clients create, simplify and refine the digital platforms their users get in contact with. To do this successfully, I work to understand my client&rsquo;s challenges at a large and small scale, and their users&rsquo; needs to create something that works for both. My job is not unlike a digital (and better!) version of Doctor Frankenstein. When looking at or putting together a digital experience, I&rsquo;m the one in charge of the bones and muscles. I shape the body and give it the right form and elements so it can swim, run or walk. This means I get to know its overall environment and create something that it&rsquo;s best suited for it. Originally from Spain, I have now spent over 10 years in the UK and worked in four different countries. My international experience gives me a better overview of how people differ and how to best adapt to designing for them. Alongside my day-to-day work at Foolproof, an experience design agency in London, I enjoy helping people discover the world of UX. I often get involved in mentoring events such as the Global Service Jam and I have recently worked as teaching assistant at General Assembly, helping professionals understand and think like a user experience designer.

  "about":"Scott has worked for almost 25 years in user experience design. After earning a Masters from Queens University, he did UX design for Bell Northern Research and Nortel; before it was even called UX design. He has been a UX consultant since he co-founded Maskery in 2001 and then subsequently joined Macadamian in 2006 when Maskery was acquired. Joining Macadamian, his focus was to find a way to integrate engineering and UX design to find ways to keep UX design a focus on the product all the way into the market, and not just in the design spec. Since becoming Vice President of UX at Macadamian in 2010, Scott has continued to amass knowledge and experience in industries such as aviation, telecommunications, finance, legal and healthcare. He loves working in these big, complicated domains; working with organizations to change the way they do design. Scott is strong component of &ldquo;everyone on the team designs the product\/experience&rdquo; with the role UX professionals to lead and facilitate the whole experience definition. Scott&rsquo;s focus in the past several years has been to try and push design even further up the product creation process. Getting UX professionals involved in the essence of the business case, value proposition, as the business reason for pursuing a product comes to life. He&rsquo;ll stop at almost nothing to get key decision makers and stakeholders in a room with UX professionals as soon as possible to aid the creation of a great product and customer experience.",
