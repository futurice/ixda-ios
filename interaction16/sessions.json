  "description":"Every day, apps vie for your attention. Someone retweets, sends a message, or texts you. An app wants you to know that it hasn\u2019t forgotten about you and sends a push notification. Every time, your phone lights up, your Apple Watch taps you on the wrist, and you lose focus on whatever it was that you were doing before getting distracted.<br> Right now, notifications are all or nothing: your options are to receive them, or disable them altogether for any given app. Within the notifications you do receive, there is very little sense of hierarchy. What is relevant right now? What can you ignore? How can you tell the difference?<br> We want to propose an alternative to the current system. By taking inspiration from the principles of soundscapes and information landscapes found in nature, we are exploring a way to make notifications less jarring, more adaptive and, ultimately, less distracting but more meaningful.<br>",

  "description":"The workshop explores how motion design can turn often overlooked in-between moments in user interactions into delightful signature brand experiences. These are things that impact the overall impression of our experience. In the digital world this is often overlooked and users are left guessing after an interaction. With small adjustments to your process you can make sure that you minimize the impact of long loading times and completely remove elements of confusion. You will learn the pros and cons of different prototyping tools, why merging tools are important to create motion and interactions. We will then focus on After Effects and Proto.io to create within the workshop an interactive prototype. Key points; <ul> <li>Designing for the in-between moments of an experience<\/li> <li>Merging motion design & interaction design<\/li> <li>Designing without the boxes<\/li> <\/ul> Today technology has reached a point where animated interfaces are common, whilst having little effect on performance. They are often used to make products look prettier and add some flare to a splash screen. We believe that animation is a tool that should be used for function first and foremost. <strong>Workshop requirements:<\/strong> <ul> <li>Laptop<\/li> <li>After Effects CC 2015 software<\/li> <li>Proto.io registered account<\/li> <\/ul>",

Of these 2.4 billion, an astonishing 946 million people defecate in the open. Open defecation is threatening survival rates and other health measurements of children living in rural areas of developing countries. In this lightning talk, I\u2019ll describe a game-based approach to addressing this challenging public health issue.<br> Doo Doo Dash is a simple, single-player mobile game that teaches kids (ages 6-9) the health dangers associated with exposure to feces, and the importance of using toilet facilities for defecation. The message of the game is simple: open defecation is bad; it makes people sick. The game ensures long-term behavior change by addressing psychological principles in the Theory of Planned Behavior. Want to learn more about Doo Doo Dash and how you can design for social change? Come to this lightning talk, where we will discuss the game in detail to inspire a larger conversation around designing for social impact.<br>",

The first example of good design that we saw as kids was through our interactions with video games; the way they guided us, but never explicitly informed us and the pride we felt when we achieved a goal in the game as if it were \u201cours.\u201d We became designers so that we could create things that lifted people up, cheered people on, and connected people to their friends. We became designers to we all could play together. <br> Years later we can\u2019t stop seeing the many parallels between interaction design and video game design. In fact we keep seeing the future of interaction design coming closer and closer to the field of video games. We see the future of interfaces that allow us to play, discover, and connect to people in a positive and wonderful way.<br> Explore with us in a playfully interactive session the essential tenets of video game design and how they can inform more interactive and engaging experiences.

  "description":"Machine learning software is changing the daily practices of designing user experiences. It used to take multiple steps to find, open and review an upcoming flight confirmation, where now it shows up immediately as a notification that pulls information directly from an email. How are designers creating user flows and journeys for the invisible actions machines take to generate a desired experience? How are designers influencing these data-driven decisions so that they are considering the user\u2019s needs and emotions? At Airbnb, we are exploring new design languages and processes that help to illustrate key data-driven moments in a user\u2019s flow. These visualizations give greater visibility to the broader product team and help us to make informed decisions for the user experience. The design team is combining traditional methods of wireframes and user flows with new methodologies to elucidate how an explicit trigger kicks off implicit ones that end in a result we believe is right. Data decisions are inherent in our user\u2019s journey and how we tell stories about the vision of our product. This talk will cover some basic principles of designing with machine learning in mind and thought-starters for how the audience might start to create new processes of their own.<br>",

This project explores relations between subjectivity and raw data by combining hard data with and visual mapping. Cities and their intrinsic diversity can be compared; as well as slight differences in the input variables can present greater changes in a recurrent path.

  "description":"Designing for the IoT requires a systems approach to UX: considering ecosystems of distributed devices and cloud services. Where does information processing happen? How do devices work in concert? What is the experience of the network itself: the spaces between devices? In conventional UX, we often assume that devices are constantly networked, with data almost instantly synced. This is rarely the case in connected products\/IoT, and delays and discontinuities are not edge cases: handling them is part of the core UX. To create a really slick UX, designers need to understand the characteristics and limitations of IoT technology. This workshop will give participants practical knowledge of the issues in designing for connected product ecosystems.",

One option as you progress in your career is the move to management. But should you do it?<br> I want to share with you the 4 big lessons I learned through my experience managing a UX team. I use insight from the experts to provide a deeper understanding of what great leadership really is, while relating it back to the specific challenges of being a UX manager.<br> As an interaction designer you already have many of the skills needed to give you a head start in the move to management. But there is more to it than what appears on the surface. One of the most difficult parts of being a manager is building the emotional intelligence to bring self awareness, empathy and humility to the role. These traits are more important than those commonly portrayed by the \u2018charismatic leaders\u2019 of popular culture and they are things that can be learned. In my talk I will demonstrate how these come into play with examples of common issues that you might face as a UX manager.<br> Being a good manager takes time and effort as well as a shift in focus away from the pure practice of design. But it is in many ways its own design challenge that brings great satisfaction. And the skills you will learn are life skills, not only work skills.<br>",

As our cities are becoming a hybrid space, being a digital and physical frame for a society producing and consuming data, we need to envisage new visual codes to understand how we interact with this connected environment. Participants will be invited to reflect upon the questions of privacy and accessibility in order to design a signage highlighting how digital urban services work. They will especially try to represent sensors and algorithms activities, to raise awareness about the presence of smart pieces in the urban space. These visuals codes will be designed to help people visualize both acknowledged and unaware interactions with the networked city. This workshop is addressed to anyone with interests in responsible innovation for smart cities, interaction design applied to urban stakes, social issues linked to digital technologies or the Internet of Things.",

The workshop explores the role of storytelling in digital service design. With the constant rise of new emerging technologies, new challenges arise impacting various areas of design. Allowing for non-linear and more continuous experiences, the user is empowered to alter the course of the narrative and the way content is experienced and explored. The static world of websites and apps is challenged by new technologies such as Google Cardboard, Occulus Rift, and connected devices, all of which require the creation of continuous, multi-routed storylines that Occulusinteraction Design is crafting and orchestrating, as interaction allows the user to be more deeply involved with the content the story thereof. Instead of presenting a linear feature, the user can follow various characters and affect the outcome of the story. This results in more dynamic stories and outcomes, captivating the user and enhancing the user experience. <strong>Take away:<\/strong> Let's forget about connected devices and stop being carried away by the splash of immersive experiences but let's rather focus on the core that brings them all together \u2013 the story behind. Any connected product, for instance, is a physical device with a digital service at its heart. So we should focus on the experience and the design of the service to start with in order to evoke emotions, to connect and to convey.

For example, we had several ways of asking for a date of birth, and we knew that some worked much better than others.<br> We wanted to share best practices between designers, and spread more quickly what we were learning from our extensive user research.<br> We knew we wanted to create some design patterns. But we\u2019d seen many pattern libraries fail: full of great advice, launched with great fanfare, but largely ignored and quickly out-dated.<br> From the start, we put as much effort into building the community around our design patterns, as we did building the patterns themselves. And we now have a community of designers, user researchers and others that actively discusses, challenges, and updates the patterns.<br> In this talk we\u2019ll describe how we create and maintain our patterns, how we involve colleagues across government, the lessons we\u2019ve learned and our future plans.<br>",

Navigating through a city can be easy as pie or your own personal nightmare \u2013 often it depends whether you live there or not. As locals, we can take the public transport system of a city for granted but it is as visitors that we really put the tools available to the test.

  "description":"Does your AI have a female voice, like Apple\u2019s Siri or Amazon\u2019s Alexa? If so, does she talk like a woman? Should she? Psychologists have analyzed large bodies of text in the world and discovered that men and women use \u201cfunction words,\u201d such as pronouns, articles, and prepositions, in significantly different ways. The data consistently show that women use I-words (I, me, my) about 12% more often than men. Men use articles (a, an, the) more than women. Women use \u201ccognitive\u201d words (understand, know, think) as well as \u201csocial\u201d words (words that relate to other human beings) more than men. Men use more nouns and women use more verbs. It is important for developers of verbal user interfaces to know about these findings because it is in their hands whether AI personalities perpetuate these differences in language use. On the one hand, doing so might make your \u201cAlexa\u201d seem fractionally more real. On the other, however, replicating these patterns in the language of AIs might serve to perpetuate gender inequalities, in society and in the new forms of human-machine relationships that are emerging today. <br>",

  "description":"Today, healthcare is reaching a critical point in design. Once debilitating diseases are now managed by medication. What remains are chronic conditions. With a population living longer, healthcare is less about treating acute health issues. It is about supporting users in managing their conditions. It is about building healthy habits so that users can get back to enjoy life. The process to get there is designing for behavior change.<br> But what works for behavior change? For people who fear change due to its low perceived value? For people who are in denial of their condition? The answer is: compassion, because it taps into the emotions that leads to a decision to change.<br> This session highlights a use case that demonstrates behavior change: a diary study from Livongo Health, a service to support people with diabetes. Each participant received a daily text message containing: \u201cHow are you feeling? Did you check your blood glucose? Where is your meter right now?\u201d The first question impacted behavior, because it functioned as an compassionate question rather than a reminder. Participants become self-aware and began to acknowledge their condition. Upon review, participants observed, \u201cI never knew that about myself\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be heard.\u201d Then they began moving toward a decision to change.<br>",

  "description":"Most experiences in life are punctuated by a closure experience. In the past these were profound; however, over generations we have distanced ourselves from meaningful closure experiences thanks to our lifestyles increasing in comfort, the church weakening and medicine advancing. This has seemingly freed us from the shackles of the ultimate closure experience - death - and sanctioning our personal pursuit of heaven on earth in the form of consumption. We are now encouraged to drunkenly stumble from purchase to purchase, with any sense of longevity and responsibility removed. Long term side effects of this are exampled in the Product, Service and Digital landscapes that we frequent. The consequences of our behaviour results in a changing climate, industries fined billions for mis-selling and individuals casually eroding their personal online reputations.<br> As designers we are active in the creation of services, products and digital products; making them attractive, engaging and usable for consumers, but we often overlook concluding these experiences for the user in a responsible way.

In this session, we will discuss the value in investing experiential technology, and the insights gained when you can test quickly, often, and live in a public setting with social and environmental pressures. We will be closer to our users than ever before.<br>",

  "description":"At Interaction '11 in Boulder Colorado Dick Buchanan told us that an interaction is \"how people relate to other people through the mediating influence of products.\"<br> Earlier, at Interaction '09 in Vancouver, Robert Fabricant told us, that \"interaction design is not about computing technology.\" Instead, he argued that \"Behavior is our medium.\" <br> These statements have become uncontroversial in the world of interaction design, and yet when we talk about design methods, we still talk about methods for designing products and for human-computer interfaces. We have a body of methods to design products (the \"mediating influences\") but very few tools and approaches available to work with the larger systems of interaction.<br> Recently though, we've seen teams having success with methods that blend Service Design, Lean Startup, and Lean UX methods into what I call \"Learning From Live Systems\" approach. By launching services early and powering them with a mix of software and human \"concierge\" services, teams are able to develop and test systems even as they are under construction.<br>",

  "description":"Space matters. We read space like we read people's faces. Space is an instrument of collaboration and innovation. At the University of Michigan\u2019s Institute for Clinical & Health Research (MICHR), a team was created to creatively and economically enhance our operating space into a flexible workspace that supports privacy, innovation, creativity, and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 a culture of collaboration. The team used a human-centered design process to creatively engage the staff at large into analyzing our existing space, identifying latent needs, proposing solutions, generating feedback, and economically building the rethought space. The redesigned workspace embraces the differences among MICHR\u2019s teams while encouraging collaboration and teamwork and keeping costs at a minimum. It has resulted in a flexible space that includes co-located teams, spaces dedicated to different work goals, an open area for collaboration, quiet zones to support focused work, and better wayfinding.<br> More information can be found at: www.rethink-space.com<br>",

  "description":"As designers migrate in-house into senior leadership roles for product and UX, they are increasingly becoming our clients. This is not a new phenomenon in consulting - ex-consultants from McKinsey or Accenture routinely hire teams from their own firms. In fact, many of them prefer to do so. But they have also, in many cases, figured out how to be \u2018good\u2019 clients in order to get the most out of these teams and continue to support their alumni networks. Many design leaders, particularly the new breed of UX design leadership, are \u201cfirst generation\u201d and don\u2019t have the experience to model this sort of behavior. In too many cases, in our efforts to stay \u201cclose to the work\u201d we end up being pretty lousy clients. This talk will look at common pitfalls, and more importantly, make the case for the value of investing in building a robust class of designer-clients within our community.<br>",

It\u2019s widely perceived as a \u201ccool and interesting feature\u201d for brands and advertising, but doesn\u2019t have much practicality yet. To harness the real power of AR, which includes geolocation, image recognition, we believe that a more utilitarian visual search would be next. <br> To design for such possibilities, we begin to question even the fundamental basis of AR. For example, what would AR become beyond a rich visual layer? Will this change people\u2019s motivation and behavior to use AR? How can we redefine AR to be a tool to give augmented information on objects? And how we can speculate its usage in the future?<br>",

It won\u2019t be just boxes and arrows, though. Most systems and services need business, technology and design combined to bring them to life, and we\u2019ll be looking at all of these.

On the other hand, it supports the frequent use of experiments to test different assumptions about the service at hand, be them about business models, people or technology. design and technology expertise to look holistically at the total value delivery of a service.

It is not only a struggle in creating simple and amazing experiences, rather in creating trustworthy ties with the user. My focus has been on financial credits, mortgages, and insurances. I got a tumbling start thinking 'how can they trust your financial webpage, when they have even trouble in trusting their banks online'. In latin american countries, where there is so much insecurity in the country overall (crime rates, economic strife, etc.), they trust family and friends rather than experts. In order to create a solution, I had to turn to emotional design. Through transparency, empathy, friendliness, and a simple learning process for the users you can create the trust needed for the users to use the financial products.

Companies such as Twitter, Slack, AirB&B have come forward to address the fact their teams and leadership boards do not reflect the diversity of the consumer markets they serve and what key steps they are taking to address this. <br> I believe this is a soul-searching moment for our industry and one we should discuss and act upon. I would like to discuss my thoughts on this matter from my perspective as designer of African-American descent who has spent the past eight years working across 13 different countries with various well known and respected multinational teams.<br>",

Yet, despite the current focus on keeping data safe, user interactions with security products do not reflect many of the advances interaction design has made in the past ten years. From top to bottom, the cyber security industry has relied on fear to motivate its customers and users, but this is starting to shift. As designers, we have an opportunity to be part of this shift and to create a better and safer\u00a0experience for our users.<br> Designers working in the field of health and wellness have learned that just waving a terrible possible future in front of people does not motivate behavior change. In this talk, we will take a rapid fire look at examples of security interactions and ask how the insights from other areas of interaction design can be applied to achieve better outcomes.<br>",

The need to think the customer experience through on several channels challenges us to envision a cohesive system that delivers delightful experiences. Systems thinking is a relevant tool for designers and entrepreneurs facing this challenge, helping us to untangle complexity, to consider the business implications, impact and ethics of the interactions we are creating. In this workshop, we will explore how to apply systems thinking theory to designing digital products. Attendees will walk away with: <ul> <li>Knowledge about systems thinking theory<\/li> <li>An understanding of how systems thinking methods can be used as part of a business and product development process<\/li> <li>Tools and techniques for modeling and evaluating systems<\/li> <\/ul> The workshop will be a combination of lecture and hands-on exercises. We\u2019ll work on a Business Model Canvas and on a Rich Picture Diagram in small groups. Each group will be tasked for coming up with a plan for monitoring and evaluating the system. There\u2019ll be time for group presentations and discussions.",

  "description":"Stories are everywhere, from newspapers to TV drama, fact to fiction. By deconstructing stories into fundamental, structured building blocks we can present them in new and powerful ways. <br> We can make experiences that vary the length of the story, let you explore it from different directions, summarise and recap it, change the media used to present it, adapt it to what you already know or personalise it to make it more relevant. And we can create truly responsive content that dynamically adapts to your device and context. <br> Through two case studies at the BBC, mobile news and a drama serial, I'll look at how we took a data-driven but user-centred approach to structuring and designing stories that resulted in novel experiences. The primary building blocks we use in our work are storylines, key moments and people. The storyline might be the epic journey of a character, the events in a refugee crisis or a love triangle. The essential moments and events in these storylines could be the bits people remember most fondly, the key to understanding or the jumping off points to other stories. Yet the key people or characters are almost always the most important part of a story to the audience.<br>",

  "description":"The value of measuring organizational capabilities and their maturity level has a long and well-established history. In software development, capability maturity models (CMMs) have helped organizations successfully assess strengths and weaknesses in order to prioritize investments for maximum impact. Work done by organizations like the Design Management Institute has already defined a design value index. However, in order to make the insights from the design value index actionable, we need to establish the standards and tools to help leaders understand how their organization functions and above all, how to increase the level of design maturity. In this session, targeted at design executives as well as design practitioners, Rob will explore five essential categories that shape the design maturity of the organization: empathy, mastery, character, performance and impact. He will lead participants into a conversation about specific action angles that can become the starting point to ignite the organizational development process and share results from the Artefact Design Maturity Survey, which would be piloted in the Fall of 2015.<br>",

AIs and robots will interact with us through virtual reality experiences and smart environments.<br> Conversations with Alice is a virtual reality application where the content is completely generated by algorithms. The app explores 3 different media, sound, visuals and text, all coming from different algorithmic and generative sources. <br> A dialog between chatbots is the narrative voice that walk with the player in immersive imagery that evokes the dreamy atmosphere of Carroll's Alice in Wonderland. The landscape is an algorithmic modification of panorama images taken by a robot, while the soundscape is generated parametrically. <br> The audience is called to step into a mechanical world that feels poetic and has the aesthetic of a dream. The project wants to interrogate new possibilities of entertainment and challenge the role of AI as a new factor in determining society\u2019s future power structure. <br> Is AI smart enough to create compelling stories? Do we still find interesting visuals in a VR setting that are created by algorithms?<br> Will automatically generated content have a political weight? Can we forecast the strategies that organizations will use to control AI? <br> These are the open questions that the project explores and hopefully they will be answered, implicitly or not, by the voyagers of the surreal world of Conversations with Alice.<br>",

We do not have the language, structure, or common understanding needed to define our moral boundaries as a professional community. Attendees of last year\u2019s IxD conference made this clear as they brought up ethics repeatedly during conference conversations. This workshop will help participants articulate their own personal code of ethics as well as collaborate with others to create communal Designers\u2019 Oaths. Participants will start the workshop with a gameful role playing icebreaker to get them out of their traditional mindsets regarding design and ethics. This experience will allow participants to role play through situations to define their personal understanding of ethics and learn strategies for discussing ethics in a group environment. We will introduce the Designer's Oath project and share the project's transformation. Participants will follow the project\u2019s journey from mad-lib ethical guideline into a conversational tool used by designers around the globe. Participants will break into small groups to collaboratively write and illustrate a Designer\u2019s Oath representing their group\u2019s understanding of the responsibility we have as designers to those we design for. These Oaths will be shared with the IxDA community.",
